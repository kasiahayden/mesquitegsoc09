# Abstract #

Extend Mesquite's capabilities to represent character matrices by allowing for the addition of ontology terms produced by Phenex in the Nexml format. Mesquite currently supports the Nexml file format and by the end of this project would be able to display Phenex's files directly in Mesquite, and depending on the speed of development, would display chained ontology concepts in graphical format with the use of a library like GraphViz.
